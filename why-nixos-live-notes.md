# Why NixOS? Live Notes

this is just a bulleted list for me to go down while doing a live
interactive/improv talk

- nixos <- nix
- explain difference between the two
- you should try nix because its unique!
- you should try nix because it has good package availability and probably works
on your system!
- nix is good because its not imperative!
- the unreal engine example (u cannot be sure when things are gonna change)
- apt/pacman/zypper etc are better than proprietary game engines but not w/o
problems
- devs have to make binaries for debian and binaries for arch and binaries for
Redhat
- theres almost a desire to provide the dependencies for your package
yourself...
- docker :drained:
- okay at this point we gotta talk about the UX vs devX
- NixOS and Fedora Silverblue are similiar because immutable!
- In both cases the user will have a pretty good time because their system is
stable
- Silverblue's approach is super complex and cringe though
- only devs care
- you should try nixOS because its an elegant system
- windows -> linux made me go "oh yeah this makes more sense"
- arch -> nixOS did the same
- alright now begins the demo

```bash
# split my screen to the projector with xrandr lol

# init a flake template I need to make still

```
