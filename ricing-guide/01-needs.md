# What Your OS Needs

Here are some common programs that users need to use their computer effectively.
This is largely determined by my own working style.

Programs that come with pretty much every linux distribution by default (such as
a shell or init system) are not listed here. Enhancements for them are.

Programs which I consider dependencies such as drivers and pipewire/pulseaudio
are not listed here.
