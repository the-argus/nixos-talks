# Linux Ricing Guide

AKA: How To Make Your Own Operating System

## Preface

Why are we doing this?

Note:

Some people just have a desire to:

1. have a pretty desktop
2. know what's going on in every little corner of their computer

---

## The Process

1. find a need
2. find some programs that meet that need
3. choose your favorite
4. customize it so it matches the ones you've chosen so far
    - **functionality**: change keybinds
    - **style**: change colors, corner roundness, fonts, etc
5. repeat.

Note:

This accomplishes both goals

1. each program looks nice, and also matches the others
2. you are aware of all the programs installed on your computer, what they do,
and what settings are available for them.

This is only possible because of the UNIX philosophy and the linux/FOSS
ecosystem. Everything, from browsers to file managers to movie players, can
usually be mixed and matched with other programs, and there are a lot of options
for each one.
